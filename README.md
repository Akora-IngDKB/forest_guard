# Forest Guard

The mobile app client for the Forest Guard AI Model built and deployed by Team LISA for the [AI4Good Hackathon](https://superfluid.io/ai-commons/) organized by [AI Commons](https://ai-commons.org/) and hosted by [Superfluid.io](https://superfluid.io/).

> ### The purpose of the app is to receive notifications triggered by the cloud functions upon data sent to Firestore by the Raspberry Pi running the AI Model.
